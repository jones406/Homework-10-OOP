//Use Jest for running the unit tests 

//Use Inquirer for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by entering node index.js

//The application must include Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass.

class Employee {
    name:
    id:
    email:
    getName()
    getID()
    getEmail()
    getRole() //returns 'Employee'
}
//The other three classes will extend Employee.
